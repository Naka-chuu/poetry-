.
𝐈 walk beneath a sky that spits fire,
and yet it bows to the storm within me.
Chains never held my spirit,
for even if I drown, I drown with elegance—
a requiem carved in flames.

2.
𝐈 laugh in the face of despair,
but my chest aches with quiet ruin.
Every step is a dance with shadows,
every sip of wine tastes like mourning.
Do you hear it? The world breaks where I stand.

3.
𝐈 loved the abyss once,
it spoke to me in voices made of silk and knives.
And though I carved my name into blood-red skies,
I remain the one cursed to be both sinner and song.

4.
𝐈 am the velvet coat draped over broken bones,
the smile too sharp to be gentle.
You think me a man,
but no—
I am a storm that wears a body.

5.
𝐄very scar is scripture,
written in a language only war understands.
My fists write poetry against the ribs of fate,
and in the echo of shattered stars,
I find myself alive again.

6.
𝐓he moon envies my fall,
for even in descent I burn brighter than her glow.
Every wound is a vow,
every tear a blade,
and still I rise—
red flame, unyielding.

7.
𝐈 carry silence like a crown,
and rage like an inheritance.
Even gods cannot kneel me,
for I was born to walk on ruins,
to drink the venom of eternity and smile.

8.
𝐘ou mistake elegance for weakness,
but I am the knife hidden in velvet.
To touch me is to bleed softly,
to love me is to drown.
I am tragedy disguised as grace.

9.
𝐈 am not salvation,
I am the prayer that burns your tongue.
Not light, not darkness,
but the space where both collapse.
I am the gravity of pain turned into art.

10.
𝐂huuya, they whisper,
as though my name itself is forbidden.
But my name is a storm-song,
a hymn of blood and fire.
And when the world crumbles,
I will still stand—
a requiem in human shape.
